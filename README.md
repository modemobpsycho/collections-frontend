<h2 align="center">Adding a collection</h2>

<h3>To add a collection, a name and a theme are enough, but you can also upload photos and add fields to the collection.

In order to add a photo, you need to crop it to the desired aspect ratio using the built-in block on the page

There can be endless fields, they will all be required for each item in the collection.

The description can be written using the Markdown syntax.
